2.Control structures: conditionals and loops

3.Input and output operations

4.String manipulation and formatting

5.Function definitions and parameters

6.Control Flow and Functions

7.Conditional statements and logical operators

8.Looping constructs: for and while loops

9.Advanced loop techniques: break, continue, and nested loops

10.Writing and calling functions

11.Recursion and its applications

12.Data Structures

13.Understanding and utilizing data structures effectively is crucial for Python development. 
This section will cover various data structures and their implementation, empowering you to manipulate and organize data efficiently.

14.Lists, tuples, and dictionaries in-depth

15.Sets and their operations

16.Arrays and matrices using NumPy

17.Stacks, queues, and linked lists

18.Object-Oriented Programming

Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) capabilities are a powerful tool for building modular and reusable code. 
In this section, you'll learn about classes, objects, inheritance, and other essential OOP concepts.**

19.Introduction to object-oriented programming Defining classes and objects

20.Working with modules and packages Modules and Libraries

21.Python's vast ecosystem of modules and libraries enables developers to extend their capabilities and leverage existing solutions.

This section will introduce you to popular libraries and demonstrate how to utilize them effectively.
